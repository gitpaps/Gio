<h1>About ME</h1>
<p> 
I am a multimedia artist working with a variety of media and across many industries.<br>
Recently, I have taken up coding and computer science in general in order gain a deeper understanding of computer systems.<br>
My future interests include pursuing machine learning, robotics and security systems.<br>
Some of my hobbies are sports and playing guitar.<br>
To give back, I am a volunteer in my community, as well as a Little League coach.
