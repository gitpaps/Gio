     <h1>About ME</h1>
      <p> 
         I am a multimedia artist working with a variety of media and across many industries.<br>
         Recently, I have taken up coding and computer science in order to gain a deeper knowledge of computer systems.<br>
         My future interests include pursuits in machine learning, robotics and security systems.<br>
         Some of my hobbies are sports and playing guitar.<br>
         To give back, I am a volunteer in my community, as well as a Little League coach.
